## Jobsearch! side project

Jobsearch! is a project I worked on while I was laid off to help make my job search more efficient and get my technical skills back in shape. It outlines all aspects of an agile project as I have experience in almost every role on an agile team, I wanted to demonstrate my hands on knowledge of all areas from stakeholder to core team roles to implementation manager. 

1. I have fully documented the project and you can [download and read about it here](https://github.com/larryruh/jobsearch/blob/master/ReadMe.docx?raw=true)
2. You can view the source code and even fork or clone and implement it [here](https://github.com/larryruh/jobsearch/)
3. Unfortunately the system is not available online as I dont have a public site, it runs only on my localhost.
