Project Ownership

Look at applications and see how they interface. 
•	Think about all the systems at LFG
•	Experience in creating solution proposals and system designs that cover all requirements. A.M. Crossed almost every system at LFG (Quote, rate, sell, administration, renewals, claims synchronization, billing & premiums, compensations, etc) 
•	Owned a couple environments and had to keep my eye on all project work that interfaced with them to see how or if they were affected)
•	When to sunset Applications. 
•	Evaluating new systems. 
o	Criteria (Buy or Build, how customized is it? How does it integrate? How customizable or configurable is it, how expensive it is to operate, or customize, what additional costs are present (storage, licensing). )

Diving into 12 Systems
•	At Lincoln, we had 5 claims systems, 7 applications in our core workflow and about 10 other ancillary systems that all had to interact so that is not new to me. 
•	Prior positions had a large number of systems and databases also, I’m used to that. 
•	If they have a high level system architecture diagram, it makes it easier but if they don’t have that mapped out yet, perhaps that’s item #1 on the list. 


Incoming Queues – Answering requests on a daily basis. 
•	Done this in a number of jobs, Supporting 5 lines of business si constant answering requests. 
•	ISC Hosting- Dealing with Customer requsts every day
•	Production Support Manager – new issues every day, everybody wants to go to the front of the line. Follow the process. 
•	I’m very customer service oriented so I’ll deal with all requests politely and prioritize them. 

High Visibility Applications. 
•	I’ve worked on a number of very large, complex and high visibility projects and I had a lot of interactions with the VPs of the business on a regular basis regarding status, cost, issues and things like that, not always good news, so have to tailor message to the specific exec, they all have their preferred method of communication and I adapt to that so as not to waste their time. 


How these apps integrate within system – Work through backlog of issues
•	This is exactly what I did as Prod support mgr. I had a counterpart in business area and we prioritized and assigned. 
•	I also had a scrum team in Atlanta that did nothing but compliance, it was sprint after sprint of working through perpetual backlog of compliance issues that touched all areas. 

Supporting Architects and developers. 
•	I have 8 years years of management experience doing this.

Sounds like you need a Jack of all Trades with leadership ability
•	My experience puts me directly in that category, everywhere I go, I end up coordinating a lot of things.
